Social media makes us think that we have a social life, but we do not have a social life, or at least we do not have quality social life. 

Let me explain, using these platforms, we feel we have the opportunity to make many friends, and to reach anybody, the truth, is even if it is true in some case, most of people do not use it that way, and they are just lurking in social media, wasting their time and energy in them, instead of building and having real social relationships.

I often feel disconnected from both the virtual world and the real world, whilst when I am not using electronic devices it's harder to feel alianated from the real world. Although it happens. 

The problem is that we are increasingly being pushed into this metaverse, and no one knows the consequences, some are promising liberation from tyranny, social rules and physical boundries. Although true to some extent what are we losing for having that. 

To have physical contact with people brings a skin in the game that cannot be replicated in virtual life, yes Karma points, upvotes and downvotes have some impact, but the real world is just ... more real. Meaning, that the friction in communication being way less present and the flow of love and other emotions is more real.

At the end of the day it is harder to disrespect someone in real life than in social media.

Is adding more VR AR, will help solve the problem, I do not think so, although I might be wrong, but there are maybe other forces in the universe that we have not discovered yet that play a role in the connections between people. It might be ( or surely be ) that it is not just having an image, a voice or a touch that is necessary to know and interact intimately with a person. We may have a force that only works in the vicinity of the other person, a force that only is present when we are near this person. Maybe, to breath the same air the other persons breath. This is a new skin in the game as the last pandemic showed. Breathing the same air means risking exchanging an energy or particles between the two persons.

So maybe to try to keep your intimate relationships close to you physically, and do not outsource them through some corporate screens and technology is a sound advice.

That being said, not using social media, makes you look for social life in your vicinity, and when you do not find it, because you will have more alone time without "social media apps", you reconnect to your self, your dreams, and maybe even your purposes, instead of using these devices to dream through others peoples lifes we are urged to dream and live our own and precious life.

And it is not a selfish thing to focus on your dreams when you have time to do so, instead of just looking at others living their life's through many distorting filters. *A contrario*, having time for yourself will make you calmer and less resentful, and angry; thus it will enhance your overall quality of relationships with others. 

Many times our boredom, is a trigger to check social media and news feeds,  while we feel the high for a small amount of time, feeling in a first time connected, part of a *community*, we soon find out that the time and energy we lose are not worth it. Worse, we usually feel like, forgive the word, crappier afterwards. In the same manner that drugs and addiction work we are in a vicious cycle. 

We may consider this to not be a big problem in our life, but I am sure many problems in our life are pushed aside and helplessly need our attention more that to stay staring at a screen. Many of us think, oh no it is not a big of a problem for me, a maybe for some it is the case, but I doubt it. These devices are getting in the way of many dreams, and our real social life. Like an addict who wishes to stop the addiction, when time comes on regaining control, it should be taken seriously to not look at these social apps, and to prefer boredom and doing nothing over looking at a screen. The boredom is here to help you ingest the information you ingested. Overtime, you will find yourself compeled to do what you postponed yourself to do, and you will discover how much time truely achieving something worthwhile needs. It is much more than previously thought, but much easier if only you stay on task, not looking at social app feed, or posting your small progress online.
