From what I understand, humanity has entered the end game, why well the graphs on climate shows that we are entering a phase of climate that was never seen on the earth with human's living. Those who did not follow the ecological news, are either shocked by this information or deem it a conspiracy theory, let me tell you that the latter is a normal reaction to worldscale news, whatever they are. 

So what are the cards that humanity has:
- Leave earth to preserve humanity
- Restore earth AND option 1
- Neither option 1 nor 2 which will result in the short term extinction, because as far as we know there will be a long term extinction to humanity due to the heat death of the universe

Man just writing these words give me the creeps, heat death of the universe, I am here sitting on my computer complaining how my day was difficult yet, there is a state of me that is a dead one, and I can do nothing about it, and those techonologists who think they can do something about it are either dumb or desillusioned.
