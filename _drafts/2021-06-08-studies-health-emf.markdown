title: EMF and their dangerosity

We are in times where the use of wireless technology is widespread, we are also in times where new diseases are emerging or growing exponentially. To find a link of causation between the effect of technology on health is complicated, because first of all, we cannot subject people to high dosage of the technology in order to see if they are sick or not. The only way to do it is to examine the real world through statistics, and to find control group and the experimental group in the population. Another problem with that is that we may find correlation, but that this correlation is not really a correlation, it is just a randomness that looks like correlation. For example, you find more of certain kind of diseases linked to pollution in cities, but we cannot pinpoint which kind of pollution is the most responsible for it. This because the citizens are subject to all kinds of pollutants in the same time. This is increasing difficulty in finding a control group and an experimental group that satisfies the requirements of isolating the pollutant exposition. 

The consequences of that is that knowing the impact of a single technology on the health of people when running widespread health experiments, or in other terms, exposing people to new technology without knowing its consequences on health, poses the risk of truly having impacts on health without pinpointing that the technology introduced was bad for health. And that the increase of some disease are the result of some other issues, like stress or genes. 

These consequences means that many product will have to stay a long time and do many harm before there risk is assessed and are dealt with through regulation and law. 

While stress can effectively be a cause of many ills, the appending of other pollutants can have even more severe consequences on health, bringing the bodies into not only sickness but more dire fates.

The result of this is that we have many new technologies that are introduced that escape the vigilance of the population and science, which is then is subject to all kinds of experiments from the industrial complex, and sold all kind of benefits of these, without ever weighing the risks. Who wants to scare his customers while promoting an "innovative" product.

This tension between the introduction of technology and its consequences on environment and health are not new. Fire which is one of the oldest technologies, had many consequences on the health and the development of the human being. During many centuries, it has in the same time benefitted to humanity, whilst aiding in wars and pollutions of all kinds.

The use of fire is inscribed in many laws and it is prohibited to use it to harm of course. But happens when the harm is more subtle, like pollution from a factory that uses fire. 

A factory uses wisely the fire to build products. But what happens when the factory starts polluting too much and making people sick with pollution. Generally speaking, unless you are in a place that is ruled by law (where law is superior to the economical motives, does this place has ever existed?), the population is wronged and cannot gain its cause. Those who have money and means flee, the others suffer the consequences.  ( on the necessity of watch dogs ).

In our times, many of the problems of the modern world are linked to this tension. The tension between gain of wealth and loss of health, we are talking here about the world as a whole. The whole system. because for the individual, gaining wealth is linked with better health which is true. Wealth gives you opportunity to flee from pollutants and stressors of all kind. Money is a kind of protection. But to what extent ?. 


The world is limited in space and more pollutants cannot be escaped easily anymore.
