Today is a saturday evening, the times were the soul urges to be around people. Since college years, the isolation I feel from time to time is incomprehensible, as if our souls as humans are not made to suffer this kind of loneliness. With time, I came to see that loneliness inside a home in front of a screen hits different from loneliness in nature. 

It is as if the extreme comfort protection that is provided by the modern homes also shield not only from danger, but also from the connection to the outside world, to other people, nature and ultimately the universe.

This alienation that is felt in times when there is downtime, I see it as a wake up call and a warning. This loneliness that feels terrible to the heart is the separation that is now more and more the story of the societies we live in, the myth that we are separate from the universe. 

> The main character of any living system is openness.    Ilya Prigogine


There are many types of loneliness, but the worse of them is the loneliness that feels empty, the loneliness that when it hits, you know you're not in a good place in life, maybe with yourself, with other people, or with God. 

The other type of loneliness is the one when you feel connected to everything and everyone though you are alone. This one is the good one that makes up for good memories, and this one can even lead to full enlightenment experiences. 

> „We seek to move from the self of separation to the self of relationship that knows that everything outside is also inside. Then we are not alone. This is not something we can accomplish in the normal sense of the word. It cannot be another achievement of the separate self. Rather, it is a gift we can receive—and it is a gift we can pass on.“ —  Charles Eisenstein

To fall more into the second type, one must follow a path of heart in making life decisions. Of course, life is tricky and will not let you make those heart decisions easily, you will get asked and tested time and time again until it makes sure you are really committed to the path, and then to show you a new version of itself. Most times, we stay in an indecisive state. But that is not an issue as life always, proposes this path time and time again until the end.

This uncertainty and always moving and flowing choices that life generates, and prompts us into choice in a chaotic state looking universe, is one of the most challenging aspect of living as a human being. Of course, many of our choices are automatic, and are prompted by taking the same choices as the herd, and it is not a bad decision to follow the herd, following the herd is a good survival strategy, unless you have a piece of information that the herd cannot listen to or don't know about. Then it is just logical to not follow blindly, you tell your piece of information, most likely you get rejected unless the information is ready to be taken and considered true and valuable. It ensues, a period of tribulation for both the herd and the caller to the new information, for him it is the tribulation of rejection and non understanding, therefore leading to loneliness, for the others it is the tribulation of having the story of the herd falling apart, and having to reorganize painstakingly all what has been acuired throughout the years of order in the herd.

> The future is uncertain... but this uncertainty is at the very heart of human creativity.  Ilya Prigogine

This tension between order and chaos in groups and individuals is cyclic throughout the ages, and repeats itself with variations across times, this tension is the creative force, if we have only order, we can never crreate anything new or different, if we had only chaos we cannot create something, because the act of creation if an act of ordering out of chaos. 



the story of all prophets and revolutionaries, follows the same hero journey.

It is important to understand the hero journey in order to detect it when it happens in your own life, understanding these stories not just as pieces of history but as current programs that run the plots and stories beneath the program that we call life in human society, is necessary to not lose your own mind, when weird stuff start happening in life, and weird stuff will happen in life especially if you are the type of person that lives on the edge of society and is extremely of the observing type. 

That being said I am not here going to give you advice on haw to not be lonely anymore, you can google and find many articles about this, or can search quora for better advice, my goal here, is to help you walk through loneliness, and see what loneliness will give you as a gift. In order to do, you ought to see that every experience presents us with a gift. The gift of loneliness is to urges us to know ourselves, and it is said the one who knows himself knows their Lord.

> "Know yourself" is a principle that many theosophists, even before
> Socrates, have emphasized upon it. But, the philosophers' approach to
> this principle is different from that of mystics. According to the
> philosophers, the self is nothing but the soul in a general concept (alnafs); so for them, self-knowledge is known as a kind of psychology,
> a branch of knowledge among others. But for the mystics, especially
> for Ibn 'Arabi, the real Self is much deeper than the soul, and selfknowledge is the ultimate goal of mysticism.

Here I am going straight down into a religious explanation before going into psychological explanations.
