I don't know much about statistics and the further I know about statistics the more ignorant I feel about the world, and this urges me to ask, of how should we go to learn about the world? 

Should we need always statistics and studies to inform our decisions, should we go with intuition that comes from sensory experience and life stories? Should we follow our heart? And if we follow our heart what does that mean? Is there a way to make the heart see with precision what it needs and wants? and whatabout harmful wants?

In other words where do we find the truth? and before starting to speak about the truth how shall we define the truth? is there only one truth or are there many truths? and if there are many truths how can we make peace between these truths? and if we make peace between these truth have do we find a higher truth that is actually the one truth that we needed from the beginning, and thus we had ONE truth.

This implies many things that many conflicts may be just imaginary, and are the results of miscommunication and not not agreeing on precise things, so if we do not agree on precise things may be we do agree on a higher value, why do we hold on to imprecise truth instead of acknowledging common truth which are by definition higher truths.

to be continued ...
