It’s better to leave a misdeed undone.
A misdeed burns you afterward.
Better that a good deed be done
that, after you’ve done it,
won’t make you burn.

For the work to be virtuous, it needs to be Good work, that does not waste time, energy and resources, and that does not compromise the virtous work of others.
