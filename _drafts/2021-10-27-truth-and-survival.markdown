What do you do when you a secret that you can share to no one, and this secret is an information that only you (or a group of people) know about your self or about the world make you look weird for the rest of the world. 

Looking like an idiot because you can't share the whole story or you can't explain the whole story, or simply the other party cannot see your story, is a very common human experience. Yet when it happens to us it is very lonely in its nature, the sentiment of not being able to share all of us, is a sentiment of loneliness. 

"I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone. - Robin Williams"

Or in other words with people you cannot share everything or an information that will either make people doubt your credibility, make you look stupid, or simply shun you from their social circle.

The fear of social rejection, makes a lot of us compromise as it is in our biology to do so in order to survive. 

"Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon and the truth. -Buddha"

Thus we always have some special truths we know are true that are unsharable, or even if sharable do not reach consensus within the group and are rejected. What we fear most is that truth stays rejected for a too long a time before it reaches back to the group, in the meanwhile the individual suffers in a state of prophecy, sure the gift of prophecy of truthfulness is riddled with pain as history shows.

"Groups Search for Consensus, Individuals Search for Truth. -Naval" 

What to do to live by your own truth without losing sight of the benefits of living in society?

Still cannot find yet a solution to this problem, because it is a paradoxical one. As any major truth, ain't it? Because you ought to look for truth at all cost, and you ought to protect your livelihood at all cost, but is a there place where both are achieved.
