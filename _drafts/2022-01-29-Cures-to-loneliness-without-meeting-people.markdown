Many days we get lonely without any plan to meet someone, of course the best way to sooth loneliness is to meet gentle friends and people that you love and love you back, yet this is not always possible at the time the loneliness crises attack. Or simply you are not in the mood to meet other people, yet still you feel the need to share and give. 

To cure the heart, there are some ways that help :
- Prayer, and deep meditation 
- Journaling 
- Reading
- Making music
- Learning something 
- Walking 
- Working out
