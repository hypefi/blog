Spiritual practice, and soothing music to find peace.

> “Nobody can bring you peace but yourself.” —Ralph Waldo Emerson

Finding peace is difficult, maybe it is one of the most underrated pursuits in life, many are looking to achieve goals, but really what is behind is either peace or happiness.

And both are interlinked, true peace is the one with joyful existence. Although peace can be accompanied with sadness; with conflict happiness does not last long, especially when the conflicts are serious and threathning. 

Have you ever tried mediation and found these kind of youtube videos of soothing music? Binaural beats.

They have those claims of healing.

For many years I thought "come on you cannot be physically healed by sounds". 

But this is not as far fetched as it sounds, although some of these have very contentious claims. We know that the nervous system is what deals with pain, and the nervous system is linked to many mechanisms in the human body, and one of those is the immune system https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6191006/#:~:text=The%20immune%20system%20may%20interfere,by%20the%20blood%2Dbrain%20barrier. 

So modern science in its all materialism, knows that the nervous system and the immune system are very much related and interdependent. Many people know that stress cause illnesses. But to not what extent it does so. 

Stress can take a big toll on the nervous system, and impact the mechanisms of immune system and endoctrine system (the system that deals with hormones, or in other terms the chemicals that are responsible for many of the equilibrium in the body, by carrying messages through your blood to your organs, skin, muscles and other tissues.

Hence,having an equilibrated mind, means an equilibrated nervous system means the body works good. 

Of course the body and the mind have long been known to not be seperated, but the current trend in modern medecine is going toward a worldview of separating, where every system is cut alone and dealt with it alone, where you can deal with the problems of the mind alone, and the problems of the body alone, without questioning whether the mind is causing problems to the body or vice versa. 

Many psychological problems are due to biological problems, and many body problems are due to unhealthy mind.

> It's impossible to heal the body, without healing the soul - Socrates

In an age of social media, news, and constant struggle with toxic information that disturbs the mind. The bodies are also affected, (you can also add the whole set of pollutants that were added by the modern age which are a bigger problem).

This mind problem can be rebalanced through meditation practices ( that is why it is exploding in notoriety these last years as mental health problems are increasing and many people are trying to find refuge in ancient methods of mind and soul care )

What the soothing music can do is that it unlocks the flow of thoughts, and especially conflictual thoughts that can be a source of unneeded stress that comes from relationships, fast paced environments, and too much information.

By constantly unlocking the thoughts, the stress goes away and the river of peace may flow again. Certainly, this is not a solution to all problems, you still have to deal with life problems but having a calm and peaceful mind is much needed to solve them.

Peace
