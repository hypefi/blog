There is a link between emotions and music, and also emotions are linked to the mental state which changes the quality of life of a human being. Therefore music can alter the quality of life.

Choosing what to listen to should not be by chance all the time, although discovery is necessary and part of the listening of music experience, ending up listening dubstep all day long is a bad idea if your aim is to have a peaceful and quiet mind. 

There is something I've been exploring from a long time ago, and that now as a skill I am honing more and more as it proved to be extremely useful to deal with the problems of my life, is to deal with my internal emotions as a sort of playlist of music, they are sort of vibes that repeat themselves and give the "tone" of the moment. to solve my problems I use filters and decide wether or not to listen or not to that vibe or music.

Of course, I am not the only one experiencing this, the internet is filled with memes of people telling others I don't like your vibes, or something similar. So let me explain more.

The vibes in this case give direction to the spirit, they can guide you to do an action or not, many time lack of motivation is really a lack of internal music that is in harmony with the task in hand, if you do not harmonize yourself with the task in hand before getting into it, you'll either do a poor job or would not like to do it at all. Of course, many people do these things naturally without any need for harmonizing, they are by habits harmonized with their day job, as they do it everyday, they do not have tto change the "tuning" much as they almost do the same tasks everyday, which is a good thing, habits are necessary to build compounded experiences and interests. 

What this theory really can come in handy, is when you are lacking direction, you are not set in one direction, then a multitude of paths are brought forth before you, that time if you are not ready you may end up lost. Many times standing there you hear all the music that comes from different paths, their emotions and vibes, it can become a cacophonia, if this cacophonia is brought too close to the mind/heart by means of stress it can lead to insanity. most of the time cacophonia is heard from afar, and people apply filters and choose one or two paths to pursue, they listen to these paths, their vibes and emotions, and also thoughts that float in that realm.

Learning to listen to the vibes and meditate on them, can help you unlock situations that are just impossible to handle by thought and logic alone. Flowing throughout a situation is way better and thinking yourself out of a situation.

One of the most bigger blockades I've experienced is the entanglement of two persons, when they are by some way or another obliged to listen to the same music, just that one of these persons do not want to listen to the same music anymore. The best way to strip yourself out of this situation is not to fight back the music, you will only creates cacophonia, but to quiet the mind, and flow out toward another music by gently changing your course of life by changing the vibe you give attention to. 

This can happen at the level of communities of millions of people who listen to the same music, vibes or calling.

Everything is connected

Music, mind, logic and heart.

This is what some call intuition

but we need better terms that see through intuition, intuition is complex and a dimension all in itself, that needs to give way to more study and seriousness.

But of course our world is obsessed with materialistic phenomena, only the phenomena that can be seen, heard, measured through the five senses and instruments is taken seriously. The mind is used as a tool to dissect and analyse the data, but not as a sensible organ in of itself that can also dissect and analyse.

Music, stories and logic
