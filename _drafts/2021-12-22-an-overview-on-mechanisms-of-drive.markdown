### The mind works with routines.

It means that routines are launched automatically at every moment of the day, if you make it a routine to check something out at a certain time frame the mind will automatically and efficiently do so, unless something more urgent happens, hoping to the urgent thing or thinking about changing plans is time and energy consuming. The brain always want to go back to the routine style work. 

Routines are important even for creative work, for routines helps you establish the framework where your brain will set aside mental power and availability for the creative work, stopping all other routines. If you do not have the routine of setting aside time for creative work and thinking about it you will never be able to the work.

One thing that is important about creative work is that you can set aside time for it and feel unable to perform on it. When this happens, you should not revert to other means of passing time (in order to not lose time) you need to sit and look at your creative work and do nothing just stare at the blank page, the blank screen, and sit for the whole duration of the work you needed to do even if you do not do nothing, the mind works in this time to solve its internal problems that blocks creativity, and furthermore does not erase the routine of doing creative time at this timeworn, but the mind knows that the time was bel et bien set for this to think.

The more you are specific in the routines the better, just say this 3hours are for coding, and sit there don’t do nothing except thinking about code and writing code, if you can’t write code just think about code and list what you need to learn, what you need to do, what did not work out in the past, what should be performed next, but do not consider it as job done, observe the obstacles that resist the flow.

### The mind works with event like programming also

It means that the mind reacts to events, sounds and sensory, which means that the brain is stimulated from outside, into avoiding harm, and planning to avoid harm, and maximizing pleasure and confort, the mind has also another precortex that makes it able to plan and workout and avoid instant gratification in order delay it to another time, it is a very distinct feature of the human brain that can perceive time, and history. It can therefore learn from history, learn from books, from seeing, but especially from doing. and doing with others, doing with specialists, there is mimic doing.

Creative work is the most difficult of work in the measure that is not always drivable, and programmable. You can automate everything about it, but the mind heart and body need to be in phase to attain peak performance. There are many factors that urges into not doing so in some times. The surrounding environment is the first of them, when everything is falling apart around you it is difficult to work, but it can also be a driver to work, when no value inside you or outside you drives you to do work, you seldomly do the work for a long period of time;

Thus you can do a work for period of time, but to do it in order to attain mastery you need to do it for long period of times, which means you cannot expect incentives of money and reputation, to drive you only. They can be great drivers maybe the greatest drivers but they can also be the greatest obstacles. the idea of I do not get money or reputation from it why should I do it has killed way too many talented endeavors.

Thus the occurrence of many things are necessary in order to attain productivity of value at a single level 

- the social drive
- the inner drive
- the mastery reputation drive
- the money / comfort drive 
- the pleasure drive
- the avoiding harm drive
- the reputation drive
- the love drive
- the peace drive
- the detournment drive or counter drive ( sabotage ? ) ( work that sabotage other work ) ( comes maybe from hatred of something, sabotaging a system, because you hate it, +++> this is maybe my issue /!\ 

### On detournment of drive, the counterforce of drive, undrive force, drag, or what we may call the flow of life, or force of life,

The flow of life or force of life is somtimes a good force or sometimes can get you to not think about your needs properly to learn how to dezal with it is difficult

- I feel sometimes I am sabotaging my efforts or the efforts of others because I think that their actions are harmful. And they are in many times like all the efforts that bring us comfort but at the same time are destroying our habitat in the short and long term. 
- > So doing is NOT always good, being productive is NOT always good, it can be very harmful, cutting wood in the forest is productive and provides comfort and material for shelter and heat but destroys the forest if done too much, that is why work in general should not be overdone and we should avoid greed , overdoing in work is felt in the body and heart and sometimes attains our values system structure, and we say, look I provide you with wood and materials that heats you and shelters you, but this same person does not tell you that it also destroys your forest and your ecosystem, he is using a way to tell that he is only doing good so you should respect him, and of course many people that only see this argument do not see the destruction of habitat environment, because for thousands of years, Earth was too vast for our endeavors, and no matter how much cuter woods, your legs and hands could not do much harm to the immense earth. But now we have developed technology that can destroys everything. So work now needs to be assessed if it good or not, and to how much extent it is good, we can let people innovate as much as they want, but we should consider making safety switch that block the production of something. it should be something that is very present in the system, and that is recognized that as soon as we find something overreaching it need to be cut, hampering the same systems that helps us is something quite strange, but not unknown of, it is in the same manner that ascetics and religious order operated, to create harmony and discipline. To cut on food and sex that are the flow of life was always used in monastries, and all religions, and this because went you cut on them you learn clarity and discernment, you can see how is the world when we don’t use food and sex and how is the world when we use them, this contrast is necessary to see the benefits and consequences of the extremes in order to find the middle ground, if you do not cut it at least a period of the year you can never recognize this and you will find yourself out of balance. You will think that it is okay to be obese, because why not; food is good, much food is better than no food you will say, but who told you that, did you try no food to see its benefits ? the same applies to the use of technology, humans cannot live without technology, but can we do a month where technology is severely reduced, so that we learn to discern between what is good an what is not in it, and find the right balance, and culling the harmful technology that is in fact unneeded.

This hard conversation is what needs to be discussed right now at all levels of society if we wish to sustain our society in the comfort it knows. This discomfort will avoid us severe discomfort in the future. 

Who are you to tell us that, I am one inhabitant of this earth and by this I have the right to speak of its rights.

(lets discuss this idea, who are you to tell us that, this comes from my friend or something like that, he is always, who are you to tell us that, and who are you to tell me who are you to tell me not to speak. By this same logic I can use it on anybody to restrict his right to speak his ideas, if you say who am I to speak, then I can tell you who are you to tell me who am I to speak ?) This cannot be a serious response. It is an ad hominem attack you are not attaxcking the ideas you are attacking me as a person.

this is what is called and ad hominem attack
