During the last years, two of my main projects that I wish to succeed are : Eksodos and Clean Green Morocco, I launched these two projects addressing two issues that seem in the beginning very different from each other but at the end rejoin the same aspects.
Eksodos is a platform to find jobs that pay in crypto, freeing you from the tyranny (let's call it that way of KYCism, corporatisms, and authoritanism) the premise is that anyone has the right to earn a livelihood as long as he is free in society, (has not committed a crime), gate keeping only some of the higher cushionned jobs to certain populations, through banking apartheid is not a version of humanity I want to see, deal with it if you don't like it. As the saying goes "If you don't say fraud when you see fraud then you are a fraud." Governments can always take taxes from many other places like consumption taxes. No need to monitor salaries for taxes too.

The second is Clean Green Morocco, which aims at ecosystem restoration and tree planting at scale, to have a clean ( from pollution, from industrialisms, encroaching of humans on space...) and regenerated ecosystems, which provide the air, water and food the necessary components for human life and flourishing, even in case of the collapse of the industrial system which is not as resilient and powerful as it may seem. Having easy access to food with regenerated ecosystems, soil and food chains, free the people from the tyrannies of having to rely of someone else for food.

Freedom is a virtue as long as it does not harm others, provides expansiveness and beauty.

"Do not be a slave to others when Allah has created you free."
