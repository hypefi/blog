I did not learn to levitate or to find peace in chaos. But what I learned is very different and an insight that could not have occured to me had I have not have had this practice. 

Let me be concise.

Electromagnetic waves are the source of many mental problems we are facing now.

The use of smartphones, wireless, and electrification, create chaos in the circuitry of the brain. The impact of radiation on the brain is it needs to work harder to make sense of of the electrical currents that are being changed. Sometimes the brain sense something is not right while everything is right, because of this the brain may enter into paranoia or frustration. Most of the time the brain either gets too angry, or too depressed. 

Many people go to the psychologist they tell them you have chemical imbalance, and start prescribing them with chemicals to find the fine equilibrium that is lost.

The biology of the brain was being modified by this environmental factor, and no amount of breathing techniques, or other meditation techniques worked efficiently without taking them off.

Electromagnetic radiation has effects on the nervous system. It is now time to treat them as they are not as invisible, odorless, soundless, sensorless artifacts. But as tangible distortion of the physical environment and thus of our bodies. 

While light and other electromagnetic waves, are known for their effects and dangers on the human body. We often neglect the effect of non ionising radiation on the biology of the body. While studies are being conducted, on the effects, and showing tangible results (see appendix). Nothing is done from a health issue perspective and the deployment of more technologies is accelarating without any laws and regulations based on health effects and real research and science. 

We should not make the same mistake as of now many products that entered the market and poisoned the climate, nature and us and that were not retracted from the market until decades later. 

Scientist have been warning of climate change for decades before politicians started acknowledging the problem without actually doing much because of the complex power structures, economics, and sorry to say it lobbying, that will be destroyed as a result of degrowth. While this is a different issue, it is similar in that it opposes health v. economy. 

This debate is always one of balance, to find the right balance between health and economy.
