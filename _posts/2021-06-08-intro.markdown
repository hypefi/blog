I am adding this blog to the billions of already available blogs in the internet, yes, and I still think you can find some value here. Why not? 

This blog is about a lot of subjects, but mainly environmentalism, technology, religion, music, science, pseudo-science, programming, guitar, books, philosophy, interesting gems I find on the internet and more... Stay tuned I would say

Anonymous blogs are best to say whatever on your mind, but does an opinion has any value if it is hold by an anonymous person? Not sure.

Skin in the game.
