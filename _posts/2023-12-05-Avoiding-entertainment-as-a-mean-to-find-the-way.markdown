"Enchantment is the means through which
â€¢ we may gain access to sacredness.
Entertainment is the means through which we distance ourselves from it."

Clearly, when you are in a tiktok frenzy or ann instagram non stop watch or any other social media, you are in a reactionary state that is not meditative or leaving space for the sacred to enter the heart and clean the home. 

The eyes are the source, the main source of information that enters the heart, when you keep giving it virtual input all day long, your heart is confused and cannot see the truth. Like mud you cannot see through it. And the only way is to settle so that the mud settles at the bottom and the waters become clear. Of course this is an old problem, which all major religions and especially mystics have delved into, but the advice is even more important now, in the age of constant distraction and entertainment. Imagine buddhists were giving the advice of settling and meditating 2500 years ago and to avoid distractions in a world who was clearly devoid of many distractions that we see today. What would they say today?

many of the problems that seem impossible to solve are not solved because no one can see through the mud, and simply everybody needs to sit calmly for a long time until it clears and people starts to understand the position of each others persons, and see through the heart of the situation. This will help solve many problems that seems paradoxical, and impossible to solve like climate change, the nuclear proliferation, AI, and so on... Challenges that are so big that the haste cannot solve them, only stillness can. 

God cannot be found in noise and agitation. His true power and love are revealed in what is hardly perceptible, in the gentle breeze that requires stillness and quiet to detect.
