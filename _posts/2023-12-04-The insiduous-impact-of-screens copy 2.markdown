We may think that screens have been around for more than half a century and that now their impact is well documented and so on... But I think that although we see this change as a necessary change of technology that has brought post modern society to fruition, we fail to realize the impact of them on our psyche. (I mean we common people although we know that they may not be that bad we don't take serious measures against them, like cigarettes in the 60's) 

From my humble observations the screens can have an impact that is so bad that is it is deadly.

Let me explain, the disassociation from real life that the screens bring is of an impact that is more severe than what we think, many people fail thus to take care of many aspects of their lives, real relationships, work, family, conversations that solve problems through serious listening and giving advice from both sides...

This all has been lost with the distraction of screens and especially entertainment through screens. 

The famous book "Amusing Ourselves to Death" speaks about of all these impacts.

You better read the book, I am not going to detail all the points but some quotes will guide your thoughts.

"All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused into indifference."

"Enchantment is the means through which
â€¢ we may gain access to sacredness.
Entertainment is the means through which we distance ourselves from it."

"It is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcotized by technological diversions."

"Americans (and thus the whole connected world) no longer talk to each other, they entertain each other. They do not exchange ideas, they exchange images.
They do not argue with propositions; they argue with good looks, celebrities and commercials."

the deadly part is that it may lead to serious mental health problems that can lead to worse outcomes.
The least of it is that you don't live your fulfilled life.

The advice is : 
Get away from social media, news and entertainment in general and live your life. 
(Of course you can always use these platforms for work and sharing, but don't stay in them for a long time they are eating your life and joy without you knowing it)
